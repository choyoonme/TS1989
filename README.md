#TS 1989 album cover

This is a minimalist rendering of Taylor Swift's album 1989 using HTML and CSS tools. The polaroid picture on the album is shown in a collection of several geometric shapes which were styled using width, height, background-color. Applied display:flex, position:absolute, and transform: perspective() to layout the shapes. The font style was taken from google fonts to resemble to handwriting on the album.
